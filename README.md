# kubernerdes.lab - My Kubernetes Lab

This is the chronicles of deploying Kubernetes (EKS Anywhere) in my HomeLab.The Kubernerdes lab.

It is worth noting that a portion of this repo is likely not applicable in most situations.  I am essentially plumbing up a new interface on my Firewall, creating a new /22 CIDR off that interface, and starting from scratch - things you would not (or could not) need to do if you were in an enterprise situation.

Goal:  to create my own EKS Anywhere environment from bare metal (Intel NUCs) and a USB stick with install media (Ubuntu Server 22.04).  I want this environment to be completely independent of everything else in my lab.

## Build EKS-ADMIN Host
You will need to install Ubuntu on "Admin Host".  While I have ways of accomplishing this with automation, *that* is not in-scope to explain here.

[Post Install Script - THEKUBERNERD](Scripts/Post_Install_THEKUBERNERD.sh)

The EKS Anywhere build process will create all the PXE bits, etc..  
The only "customization" I am going to pursue is hosting the OS Image and Hooks on my own webeserver.  
* [BIND](Scripts/Install_BIND9.sh)
* [WWW](Scripts/Install_HTTP_Server.sh)

-- NOTE:  You do not need to do ANY of the following.  ðŸ¤¯  

EKS Anywhere is incredible.

Install/Configure: 

* [BIND](Scripts/Install_BIND9.sh)
* PXE (DHCP/TFTP/WWW)
  * [DHCP](Scripts/Install_DHCP_Server.sh)
  * [TFTP](Scripts/Install_TFTP.sh)

## Deploy EKS Anywhere Cluster
